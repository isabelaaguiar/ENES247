2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DC2/count_reg[0]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DC2/count_reg[0]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DC2/count_reg[0]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DC2/count_reg[0]_C/CLR, DC2/count_reg[0]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DC2/count_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DC2/count_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DC2/count_reg[1]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DC2/count_reg[1]_C/CLR, DC2/count_reg[1]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch DC2/count_reg[0]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin DC2/count_reg[0]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch DC2/count_reg[1]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin DC2/count_reg[1]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
