# Reusable BCD hex 7seg Display Code

The  HexToBCD algorithm in the last lab worked for one hex group. The problem is that it needs to be extended from 4 bits to 32 bits. Decoders, clocks and counters need to be added. The goal is to get that done here.

## Figure out what a decoder does. Explain in the testing.

#### Testing

The decoder is turning 3 inputs into 16 outputs, in this case. Exactly two LEDs will be on all times (one y and one z), no more than 2 at once.

## 1_32bitHexTo16LEDs

This code tests the ability to count clock pulses and display 32 bits split into two groups of 16. SW[0] switches between the two groups.

#### Testing

SW[0] switches between first and last 16 digits. When sw[0] is in position 1, the digits are moving too quick, so cannot see the lights changing (they're on all the time). When SW[0] is in position 1, can see the left side lights changing. Can see the counting. SW[1] resets.

## 2_32bitBCDto16LEDs

Modify the above code using this [algorithm](https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~nmcdonal/Tutorials/BCDTutorial/BCDConversion.html) to work with 32 bits rather than 16. Which of these three is the starting point?

In addition, modify the number of bits counted, and add an overflow if needed or a reset to the counter so it doesn't appear to count to a large number and then hang or do something strange.

## 3_bitSlicing

The goal  is to find a way to grab 4 bits out a group of 32 in a single line of code.  This technique is called bit slicing.  This is similar to slicing up a string or an array in other languages.

Four Luts are used to handle the multiplying asked for in the bit slicing.

#### Testing

3 Select bits select 1 of 8, 4 bit groups from a 32 bit constant and display on LEDs.

Slicing is part of a number of languages including  [python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/slice) , [matlab](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11318724/matlabs-slice-function-not-working-as-desired) and is a common search term to find something in other languages [C](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14618342/copying-a-subset-of-an-array-into-another-array-array-slicing-in-c), [regular expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35578470/how-to-slice-characters-from-string-using-regex). *Is slice a concept or syntax in verilog*?

## 4_32bitsHexTo7segAnd16LEDs

This project is not yet finished. Please finish the documentation of it. It has  the switch between the two banks of 16 LEDs. Don't bother adding this to the port diagram.
